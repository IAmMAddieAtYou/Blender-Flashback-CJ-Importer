# FlashBlack Blender Import Add-on

**Important:** This Blender add-on is designed for use with a specific fork of the Flashback Mod: [https://github.com/IAmMAddieAtYou/FlashbackCJ](https://github.com/IAmMAddieAtYou/FlashbackCJ). Using this add-on with other versions of the Flashback Mod may result in unexpected behavior or errors.

This Blender add-on allows you to import camera animations from JSON files generated by the specified fork of the Flashback Mod. It handles the conversion of camera position, rotation, and field of view (FOV) into a Blender camera object with corresponding animation keyframes. It also provides options to adjust the scale of the camera movement.

## Installation

1.  **Save the Python Script:** Save the provided Python code for the add-on as a `.py` file (e.g., `flashblack_import.py`).
2.  **Open Blender Preferences:** In Blender, go to `Edit > Preferences`.
3.  **Navigate to Add-ons:** In the Preferences window, click on the `Add-ons` tab.
4.  **Install the Add-on:** Click the `Install...` button. In the file browser that appears, navigate to the location where you saved the `flashblack_import.py` file and select it. Click `Install Add-on`.
5.  **Enable the Add-on:** In the Add-ons search bar (top-left), type "FlashBlack". You should see the "Import-Export: FlashBlack Blender Import" add-on. Check the box next to it to enable it.

1.  **Import the Animation:**
    * Go to `File > Import > FlashBlack Camera (.json)`.
    * Browse to the location of your FlashBlack JSON file (generated by the specified fork) and select it.
    * Click the `Import FlashBlack Camera` button.

2.  **Import Settings (Adjust as Needed):**
    * **Block Size Multiplier:** This setting allows you to scale the camera movement. A value of `1.0` uses the original scale. If your scene in Blender is much smaller or larger than the scale in FlashBlack, you might need to adjust this value (e.g., `0.1` to reduce the scale by a factor of 10).

3.  **Camera Object:** After successful import, a new camera object named "ImportedCamera" will be created in your Blender scene. This camera will have keyframe animations for its location, rotation, and field of view.

4.  **Animation Playback:** You can now play back the animation in Blender to see the imported camera movement.

## Key Features

* Imports camera position from FlashBlack JSON (from the specified fork).
* Imports camera rotation (yaw, pitch, roll) and converts it to Blender's Euler angles.
* Imports camera field of view (FOV) and converts it to Blender's focal length.
* Sets the end frame of the Blender scene to match the length of the animation.
* Allows scaling of the camera movement using the "Block Size Multiplier".
